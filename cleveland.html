    <h2>About Cleveland</h2>
    <p>Cleveland, located in northeastern Ohio along the shores of Lake Erie, has a rich history dating back to its incorporation in 1836. With a population of just over 360,000, it is the second-largest city in the state. Historically an industrial powerhouse, Cleveland's economy today is anchored by health care, biotechnology, and financial services, with the Cleveland Clinic and KeyBank being two major employers.</p>

    <p>Cleveland is perhaps best known for its cultural institutions, such as the world-renowned Cleveland Orchestra and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The city also has a strong sports presence, with the Cleveland Browns (NFL), Cavaliers (NBA), and Guardians (MLB) all calling it home.</p>

    <p>Despite its urban status, Cleveland faces economic challenges, with a median household income of about $33,000, well below the state average. However, ongoing revitalization efforts, especially in the downtown and waterfront areas, are helping to reshape the city and attract new investments and residents.</p>
